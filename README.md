# Jordan Heasman — Documentation Systems Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains a deliberately constrained representation of my work as a senior technical writer operating at the platform level.

The site is designed to support evaluation by platform and engineering leadership who are assessing documentation risk, governance capability, and system-level judgment. It is not a comprehensive archive of output, a résumé substitute, or a content showcase.

The primary question this site is meant to answer is:

> Can this person be trusted to own documentation for complex B2B data or security platforms where mistakes have real consequences?

## Audience

This site is built for:

- Heads of Platform
- Engineering leadership
- Senior individual contributors involved in platform design and governance

It is not optimized for:

- Recruiter keyword scanning
- Content volume comparison
- Writing speed or throughput evaluation

## Canonical Site Structure

The site has four stable surfaces:

/index.html — Positioning and problem framing
/work/ — System-level case studies
/tags/ — Constrained semantic taxonomy
/background — Compressed verification (experience and credentials)

The homepage functions as a filter, not a table of contents.  
Case studies are the primary proof surface.

## Evaluation Model

The site is intended to be read in the following way:

- **Overview** establishes the problem class and operating stance.
- **Work** demonstrates judgment through constraints, decisions, and impact.
- **Tags** provide semantic classification by system concern, not skills.
- **Background** exists for verification only and is intentionally compressed.

If a reader is only assessing clarity or writing quality, this site will under-signal by design.

## Operating Constraints (Non-Goals)

This repository is intentionally not optimized for:

- Publishing cadence or recency signaling
- Content volume or breadth of samples
- Tutorial-style or instructional writing
- Tool demonstrations or workflow walkthroughs
- Freelance or lead-generation use cases

These exclusions are deliberate design choices, not omissions.

## Invariants

The following constraints are enforced:

- **Taxonomy is fixed.**  
  Tags represent platform problem classes and are intentionally limited. New tags are added only by removing an existing one.

- **Case studies reflect ownership.**  
  Each case study documents the problem space, constraints, decisions made, and resulting impact.

- **AI is used for enforcement, not authorship.**  
  Automation supports consistency checking, drift detection, and validation. Final semantic decisions remain human-owned.

- **Structure over volume.**  
  Signal density is prioritized over breadth. Placeholder or low-signal content does not ship.

## Maintenance & Change Policy

Structural changes to navigation, taxonomy, or site layout should be treated as system design decisions, not routine content edits.

Content may evolve; architecture should not drift without intent.
